## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


## What I learned


Practice indeed does make better. Perfect doesn't exist in the world of CSS.

### Continued development

I want to impoved on CSS properties like min, max and clamp. Still yet to get my way around them.
I also want to effectively apply the DRY principle.A lot of my code is redundant.


### Useful resources

- [Dev.to](https://dev.to/nazanin_ashrafi/how-to-stop-a-link-button-from-moving-on-hover-1c4) - This helped me figure out why buttons move when they are hovered on.
